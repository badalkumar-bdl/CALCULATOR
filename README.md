# CALCULATOR
# 🧮 Basic Calculator – Python Console App

This is a simple **Python-based calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**. It uses user input to receive numbers and an operation choice, and then prints the result to the console.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖩 Perform four operations: +, –, ×, ÷  
- 📥 Interactive user input  
- ⚠️ Division-by-zero error handling  
- 🔢 Supports floating-point calculations  
- 🧠 Simple conditional logic using `if-elif-else`

---

## 🧠 Intelligent Logic

The calculator uses a conditional structure (`if-elif-else`) to evaluate which operation the user selects:

- If the user chooses `1`, it adds the two numbers.
- If `2`, it subtracts.
- If `3`, it multiplies.
- If `4`, it checks if the denominator is not zero before dividing.
- Any other input returns an “Invalid choice” message.

This ensures a **safe and predictable** result for each operation.

## 💡 Sample Usage

```
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 4

Choose operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 4
Result: 12.0 / 4.0 = 3.0
```

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Basic terminal or command prompt

No external libraries required.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add support for more operations (modulus, exponentiation)  
- GUI version using **Tkinter**  
- Option for multiple calculations in one session  
- Input validation with `try-except` blocks
